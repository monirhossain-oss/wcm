    description: 'The Barro Negro (Black Clay) vase is a signature craft of San Bartolo Coyotepec in Oaxaca, Mexico. Using Zapotec techniques that date back over 2,500 years, this vase is hand-shaped without a potter\'s wheel and polished with a quartz stone to achieve its brilliant metallic sheen.

This vase represents a delicate balance between ancient archaeology and modern artistic elegance.',
